CacheSimulator implements three different types of caches:
1) Direct Cache (most simple)
2) n-way associative (probably the most complicated, but also probably the best)
3) fully associative (uses the custom queue class in its implementation)

CustomShell can be used just like the bash terminal (for the most part). It allows I/O redirection (but not piping), allows processes to be run in the foreground or background, etc...

Multi-Threading uses a mutex to handle a producer/consumer problem.
